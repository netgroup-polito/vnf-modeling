# NF DEV
The goal of this project is that of building a VNF model starting from its actual implementation (or something really close to it).

## Tool
The tool is composed by different parts:

	- a library that can be used to write the implementation of a generic VNF (package it.polito.nfdev.lib);
	
	- a set of verification-oriented functions and annotations in order to enrich the VNF implementation and aid the extraction of logic formulas;
	
	- an example on how to write the code of a real NAT function (package it.polito.nfdev.nat)
	
	- some JUnit tests about the NAT implementation;

## Run
TODO: Precise instruction on how to run the tool will be provided in the future. For the moment only the JUnit tests can be run.
```sh
$ java -jar ...
```
